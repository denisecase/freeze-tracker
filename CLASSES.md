Some benefits of using a class in Panel

Encapsulation

Classes allow you to group related functionality and state together, making it easier to reason about your code. By keeping the state and methods that operate on the state within the same object, you reduce the risk of accidentally modifying state in unintended ways.

Code organization

Using classes can help you better organize your code. Each class can be responsible for a specific part of your dashboard, making it clear which code is responsible for which functionality. This can make it easier to navigate and maintain your codebase.

Reusability

When your components are implemented as classes, it's easier to reuse them in different parts of your application or across multiple applications. You can instantiate multiple instances of the same class with different configurations, allowing you to create a more modular and flexible design.

Extensibility

By using classes, you can extend existing functionality or create new components by subclassing existing ones. This allows you to build on top of existing work without modifying the original implementation, making it easier to maintain and extend your application over time.
